To see some examples of LCOV generated HTML coverage reports,
and point a web browser into the resulting reports:

Default view:

  - Point your brower to
      output/index.html

Hierarchical view:

  - Point your browser to
      hierarchical/index.html

  - Note that that the coverage data is the same - only the report
    format is different:

       - Follows directory structure, similar to MS file viewer
         ('--hierarchical' flag)

       - Additional navigation links also enabled
         ('--show-navigation' flag)

Differential coverage

  - Point your browser to
      exampleRepo/differential/index.html

  - This example is slightly complicated because it emulates a moderately
    realistic project in that it pretends to see project changes:

       - updates to two project source files example.c and iterate.c

       - change to the test suite: only one test of updated
         code rather than 3 of the original code

  - The Makefile simulates this by checking code into a git repo,
    building an executable and then updating a few source files, rebuildling,
    and running some tests.

Feel free to edit the Makefile or to run the lcov utilities directly,
to see the effect of other options that you find in the lcov man pages.
