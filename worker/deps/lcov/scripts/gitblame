# gitblame [--p4] [--prefix path] [--abbrev regexp] [domain] pathname
#
#   This script runs "git blame" for the specified file and formats the result
#   to match the diffcov(1) age/ownership annotation specification.
#
#   If the '--p4' flag is used:
#     we assume that the GIT repo is cloned from Perforce - and look for
#     the line in the generated commit log message which tells us the perforce
#     changelist ID that we actually want.
#
#   If specified, 'path' is prepended to 'pathname' (as 'path/pathname')
#     before processing.
#
#   If passed a domain name (or domain regexp):
#     strip that domain from the author's address, and treat all users outside
#     the matching domain as "External".
#   The --abbrev argument enables you to specify one or more regexp patterns
#     which are used to compute the user name abbreviation that are applied.
