# p4annotate
#
#   This script runs "p4 annotate" for the specified file and formats the result
#   to match the diffcov(1) 'annotate' callback specification:
#      use p4annotate;
#      my $calllback = p4annotate->new([--md5] [--log logifle] [--verify]);
#      $callback->annotate(filename);
#
#   It is implemented so that it can be loaded as a Perl module such that the
#   callback can be executed without incurring an additional process overhead -
#   which appears to be large and hightly variable in our compute farm environment.
#
#   It can also be called directly, as
#       p4annotate [--md5] [--log logfild] [--verify] filename
